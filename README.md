# RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Milvus ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system from scratch, combining the power of **Milvus** (a vector database) and document embeddings to create a high-performance pipeline for semantic search and text generation.

With this setup, you can:
- Store and retrieve text embeddings for fast similarity search.
- Augment generative models with relevant knowledge from external datasets.
- Explore advanced applications like intelligent Q&A systems, document retrieval, and more.

---

## Features
- **Text Chunking**: Preprocess large text files into manageable chunks for embedding.
- **Document Embedding**: Generate high-dimensional vector representations using a custom embedding model.
- **Milvus Integration**: Store and manage embeddings in a scalable vector database.
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Adjust parameters like chunk size, embedding dimensions, and retrieval mechanisms.

---

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Text data (e.g., `dataset.txt`) is split into chunks using the `chunk_text_file` function.
   - Each chunk represents a logical segment of text for embedding.

2. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Each text chunk is passed through an embedding function (`DefaultEmbeddingFunction`) to produce a vector representation.

3. **Vector Storage and Retrieval**:
   - The embeddings are stored in Milvus, which allows for fast similarity searches.
   - Milvus is configured with a collection named `demo_collection` with 768-dimensional vectors.
